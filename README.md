# Manual for SGV-caller, SARS-CoV-2 genome variation caller
Jiaqi Wu and So Nakagawa

##　1. Overview
SGV-caller is software that can generate the local database on the genomic variations of SARS-CoV-2 genomes at amino acid, codon, and nucleotide levels. The SGV-caller was designed to handle SARS-CoV-2 genomes and metadata files in the [GISAID database] (https://www.gisaid.org/). In particular, it is easy to follow the update of the GISAID database. The output files generated by the SGV-caller are tab-limited text formats that are easy to read, manage and use. Data quality check of each genome is conducted, and the related summary statistics are reported. Data are saved in different format, which are easy access by R software, bash commands as well as other programming languages. Based on the outputs, it will be easy to manage variant information of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and extract the data that meet the user’s requirement.
