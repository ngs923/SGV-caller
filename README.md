# Manual for SGV-caller, SARS-CoV-2 genome variation caller
Jiaqi Wu and So Nakagawa

## 1. Overview
SGV-caller is software that can generate the local database on the genomic variations of SARS-CoV-2 genomes at amino acid, codon, and nucleotide levels. The SGV-caller was designed to handle SARS-CoV-2 genomes and metadata files in the [GISAID database](https://www.gisaid.org/). In particular, it is easy to follow the update of the GISAID database. The output files generated by the SGV-caller are tab-limited text formats that are easy to read, manage and use. Data quality check of each genome is conducted, and the related summary statistics are reported. Data are saved in different format, which are easy access by R software, bash commands as well as other programming languages. Based on the outputs, it will be easy to manage variant information of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and extract the data that meet the user’s requirement.

## 2. Dependency
  The SGV-caller software in this pipeline is using the Perl language. Please make sure you have Perl installed on your computer. In addition, multiple alignment software, MAFFT (1), is required for the software. The installation of the latest version of MAFFT is recommended.
  For Ubuntu user, the easiest way to install MAFFT is as follows:
```
sudo apt-get -y install mafft
```
If you use Mac, you can use [brew](https://brew.sh/) to install it:
```
brew install mafft
```
If you want to install using the source code of the MAFFT suite, you can install it by following the guidance of [MAFFT](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/). If this is the case, please set the path to the binary file of MAFFT programs by:
```
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/the/directory/where/MAFFT/installed
```
## 3. Instalment 
  Please download the SGV-caller from https://github.com/wujiaqi06/SGV-caller. You can also get it by running: 
```
git clone https://github.com/wujiaqi06/SGV-caller.git
```
  The SGV-caller is Perl software, which does not need compilation. First, you have to set the path to the directory of the SGV-caller as follows:
```
chmod 777 /path/to/the/directory/where/sgv-caller/installed/sgv-caller.pl
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/the/directory/where/sgv-caller/installed
```
  To use the SGV-caller, you have to copy the SGV-caller’s configuration file “sgv-caller.conf” into the directory containing the data to be analyzed. Then, set the suitables variables in “sgv-caller.conf”, and you can run SGV-caller by the following command:
```
sgv-caller.pl
```
